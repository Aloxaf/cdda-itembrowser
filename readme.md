## Cataclysm DDA Item/Recipe Browser

### Instalation

This is a vagrant environment, you only need to have a compatible debian box
installed in your computer and run vagrant up. Edit Vagrantfile to 
change the box name if needed.

I downloaded debian 7.3 from Puppet Labs: 
http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/

Everything should be up and running in a few minutes.
